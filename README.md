# EServices Assistant

This application has been developed by Muhammad Hassan working at IS&T department, SECP, Islamabad; Linkedin Profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-hassan-57615b168/ .

The app has been developed using the latest Single Page Application (SPA) and Representational State Transfer (REST) technology. Angular along with Bootstrap have been used for the front-end whereas, Node.js/Express.js along with DB2 and Oracle have been used for the back-end development.

It includes the following features:

User Management System: This allows the superuser/administrator to create a new user, granting him the access to this application.
Role Management System: This allows the superuser/administrator to add/modify roles of the users. This grants the admin right to restrict/allow roles depending upon a user.
Session Management System: Token Management System, to be more precise, maintains a session between a server and a user for a certain amount of time. Meaning, a user wouldn't be able to access this app after the token has expired.
Profile Management System: This allows each user to maintain his/her profile along with having an option to upload his/her profile picture.
